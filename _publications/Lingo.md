Lingo is a novel deep phenotyping platform for language ability, validated through genetic analyses in over 1,000 adults. This open-source tool enables precise quantification of language and cognitive abilities, addressing a key barrier in language genetics research. By providing an accessible approach to language phenotyping. Lingo facilitates the large-scale data collection necessary for genome-wide association studies of quantitative language traits, which have been historically limited by phenotyping constraints.
