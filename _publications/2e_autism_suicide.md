This paper explores factors influencing mental health in children with autism, particularly cognitive ability. We found children with autism that had high cognitive abilities were significantly more likely to have suicidal ideation than children without autism as well as children with autism and typical IQ. Interestingly, higher cognitive abilities in children without autism was related with lower rates of suicidal thoughts. These results identify a subpopulation within autism at high risk for mental health challenges, which can hopefully better identify who is at risk for suicide and provide them with more resources.
